# AI-Powered Personalized Crop Advisory System for Smallholder Farmers

## Project Goal
This project is an AI-driven solution to help smallholder farmers increase their crop yields and income. It provides two key services: instant disease diagnosis from photos and smart recommendations for irrigation and fertilizer use.

## Progress: 30% Complete (Phase 1)
This submission represents the successful completion of the **Data Preparation and Project Setup** phase.

### What's Done
- **Data Sourcing**: Acquired and prepared two primary datasets:
  - **Image Data**: The PlantVillage dataset for training the disease detection model.
  - **Tabular Data**: A synthesized dataset for the resource advisory system.
- **Data Pre-processing**: Wrote code to clean and format both datasets, making them ready for machine learning model training.
- **Project Structure**: Created a clean and professional repository with clear folder organization.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open `01-Data-Exploration-and-Preprocessing.ipynb` to see the code and data preparation steps.

## Next Steps
- **Model Building**: Develop and train the AI models for both disease detection and advisory recommendations.
- **System Integration**: Connect the models and build the final system logic.
- **Final Report & Presentation**: Document the entire process and its real-world impact.
